Dormitory Management System
Based on the project provided by our group, it appears to be a Java program related to managing buildings and zones in a dormitory. It includes functionality for adding buildings, adding zones, assigning proctors to buildings, and displaying information about buildings and proctors.
 #Features of programme: 
Here is a breakdown of the files and their functionalities:

Buildings.java: This file contains the main logic for managing buildings, zones, and proctors. It includes methods for adding buildings (both for males and females), adding zones, displaying buildings, displaying buildings with assigned proctors, and other utility methods. The class also includes a navbar() method that provides a menu for navigating through the program's functionalities.

Constants.java: This file likely contains constant values used in the program. Unfortunately, the content of this file has been truncated and is not available. However, based on the usage of the Constants interface in the tryout class, it can be inferred that it may include constants related to building types (e.g., "BUILDING_F" and "BUILDING_M").
Dorm_Access.java: The content of this file has been truncated, and its functionality cannot be determined from the provided code.

DormMaterial.java: The content of this file has been truncated, and its functionality cannot be determined from the provided code.

tryout.java: This file contains a main method where various methods from the Buildings class are called. It initializes the necessary database tables, adds buildings, creates zones, assigns proctors to buildings, and displays building details
